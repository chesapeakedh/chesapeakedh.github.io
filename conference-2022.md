### Proposal Submissions
The Chesapeake Digital Humanities Consortium (CDHC) invites submissions for its third annual conference: Digital Pandemic Studies: Public Health and Structural Oppressions
In the early 2020s we as citizens of the world find ourselves grappling with two pandemics - COVID-19 and its long tail, race and structural oppressions in public life, and all the places where these two intersect. With this in mind, the Chesapeake Digital Humanities Conference invites proposals for papers to be presented at the 2022 CDHC on any topic related to the COVID-19 pandemic and/or structural oppressions in public life, and in particular where the two intersect. We welcome original contributions from those researching and working in any field of study from anywhere in the world, especially those pursuing new research or perspectives on the effects of COVID-19 and structural oppressions. 
This year’s conference will be held virtually on Zoom in two half-day sessions on March 3rd and 4th (1-4pm). There will be no conference registration fee, but all attendees should register to be provided with access. Registration will close on March 2. All details--submission form, registration, schedule, and access information--will be available online at [https://chesapeakedh.github.io/](https://chesapeakedh.github.io/). Questions? **chesapeakedhconsortium@gmail.com**

We encourage participation from the broader digital humanities communities, including undergraduate and graduate students, early career scholars, college and university faculty, independent scholars, community members, librarians, archivists, and technologists. Within the larger theme of Digital Pandemic Studies: Public Health and Structural Oppressions, we encourage submissions on topics including but not limited to the following:

- Structural oppressions (including race, gender, sexuality, disability) and medicine - health equity analyses, historical case studies, etc 
- Pandemic and policing - state-mandated vaccination campaigns in past and present, health outcomes for prisoners during COVID, etc

**[Please submit proposals online through our form by JANUARY 24TH, 2022.](https://forms.gle/1JYaNgv9DJgFZVFr5)** All proposals will be reviewed by the Steering Committee and the Annual Program Committee. Acknowledgement of receipt will be made as applications come in. Applicants will be notified with a decision by January 31, 2022. 

### Proposal Types
All proposal abstracts should address 1) the research/pedagogical significance of the project, and, where appropriate, 2) the platform or tool used in the project.
- Individual Presentations. Please provide an abstract of 250 words. Presentations will be organized into themed panels of 1 hour in length, with time for Q&A. Presentations should be approximately 15 minutes in length, maximum. 
- Panels. Panels feature individual presentations organized around a common topic. Please provide a panel rationale of no more than 250 words, with individual presentation abstracts of 150-300 words for up to five participants. Include titles and institutional affiliations for each participant. Only one person should submit abstracts on the panel’s behalf. (note: students should specify their institutional status). Panels will last one hour each, with time for Q&A.  
- Lightning Round. Please submit a 100-word description of a topic you would like to discuss for 3-5 minutes, maximum.
- How I Made This. Please submit an abstract of 250 words. In these show-and-tell sessions, members of the DH community will introduce you to their projects in a more practically-minded manner, with an opportunity for a robust conversation following. ‘How I Made This’ sessions may foreground long-term research projects, small DH initiatives, or pedagogical projects, and should be developed with an eye towards helping conference participants get a handle on the kinds of resources available, projects in development, and opportunities for collaboration and community-building. Session leaders may elect to run a hands-on workshop, but proposals should bear in mind technological and geographical limitations. Sessions should not be organized around traditional papers. Each show-and-tell session is 1 hour in length, with at least half of the time reserved for discussion or Q&A.  

All proposals will be reviewed by the Steering Committee and the Annual Program Committee.
